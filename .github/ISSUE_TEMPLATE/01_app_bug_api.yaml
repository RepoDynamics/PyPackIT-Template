      Before submitting a report, please make sure that you are following our <a href=\"\
      https://RepoDynamics.github.io/PyPackIT-Template/contribute\">Bug Report Guidelines</a>
      to verify that: <ol>\n  <li>\n    The issue you are experiencing is in fact
      a bug, and not a documented expected behavior.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The bug
      is reproducible in the latest version of the release, and has not yet been reported.\n\
      \  </li>\n</ol> <blockquote>\n    üí° <a href=\"https://github.com/RepoDynamics/PyPackIT-Template/discussions/new?category=question_issues\"\
      ><b>Open a discussion instead!</b></a>\n    <br>\n    This verification process
      is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.\n    If you are not a collaborator
      and don't have the time to go through the process,\n    you can always open
      a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,\n\
      \    and convert the discussion into an issue if the bug is verified.\n</blockquote>
