# Local Testing


## Installation

Using [pip's VCS support](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/),
you can install the test suite directly from the repository. 

To install the latest version of the test suite, run the following command:
```shell
pip install "PyPackIT-Test1-TestSuite @ git+https://github.com/AAriam/PyPackIT-Test1.git@main#subdirectory=tests"
```

To install a specific version of the test suite, replace `main` with the desired tag or commit hash.
